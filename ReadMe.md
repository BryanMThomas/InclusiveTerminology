Scanning tool to identify and suggest alternatives to non-inclusive terms

As our language evolves so should our empathy, vocubulary, and word choice. The goal of this outlook add in is to assist in the change of deeply embedded habits. We all can begin to consider the implications of words and phrases that have long gone unchallenged and unchanged. By using this add-in we can start to replace non-inclusive terms with better alternatives. The list utilized by the app is by no means exhaustive but it provides a starting point.
